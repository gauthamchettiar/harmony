# tap-bling-erp

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted data
following the [Singer
spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md).

This tap:

- Pulls raw data from [Bling ERP's API](https://ajuda.bling.com.br/hc/pt-br/categories/360002186394-API-para-Desenvolvedores)
- Extracts the following resources:
  - [Orders](https://ajuda.bling.com.br/hc/pt-br/articles/360046424094-GET-pedidos)
- Outputs the schema for each resource
- Incrementally pulls data based on the input state 
- Do a full replication based on a start_date

## Context
Bling is an ERP system used by small and medium companies in Brazil.

## Configuration

This tap requires a config.json which specifies details about API URL, API Token and Start Date. An example of the config.json is as below:
```
{
  'api_url': 'https://bling.com.br/Api',
  'api_token': '<72 char hexcode>',
  'start_date': '2020-12-01T00:00:00.000000Z'
}
```

## Streams

[**orders**](https://ajuda.bling.com.br/hc/pt-br/articles/360046424094-GET-pedidos)
- Endpoint: https://bling.com.br/Api/v2/pedidos/page=[page number]/json
- Primary Key: id
- Replication strategy:
    - Incremental, filtering by start and end date
    - Do a request for each page until empty page is found
- Transformation:
    - **IMPORTANT NOTE**: As the API returns dates as strings at America/Sao_Paulo timezone without timezone information, and Singer.io has it's own way of handling date strings, the code will append the UTC 0 tz info without changing the date string. So all dates stored in the database will have a UTC 0 sufix, however they're in America/Sao_Paulo timezone. Example:
    - If the date stored in your Data warehouse is '2020-12-01T12:10:03 UTC 00:00', it actually represents:  '2020-12-01T12:10:03 UTC -03:00' (or -02:00 depending on day light saving time).
