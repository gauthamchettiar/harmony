```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true # Optional, to create a virtual env
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_gladly/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-gladly` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-gladly --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-gladly
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-gladly --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-gladly target-jsonl
```
