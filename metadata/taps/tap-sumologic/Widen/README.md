# tap-sumologic

`tap-sumologic` is a Singer tap for sumologic.

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

The main advantage of this version of tap-sumologic vs. other versions on github is that it
includes the ability to set the api parameter `autoParsingMode` to `intelligent`. This is a
feature that also precludes the use of the [sumologic-python-sdk](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-python-sdk)
which doesn't not allow for setting this parameter either.

Other improvements include the ability to set a start and end date for your search job 
queries, as well as other general Meltano SDK improvements.

This tap infers stream schemas based on a sample response from the query.

## Installation

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization

See the [Sumologic API documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/General-API-Information/API-Authentication) 
for details on how to get your `access_id`, `access_key`, as well as for your 
[root url](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/General-API-Information/Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-by-Deployment-and-Firewall-Security).

Most other relevant documentation can be found

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-sumologic` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-sumologic --version
tap-sumologic --help
tap-sumologic --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_sumologic/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-sumologic` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-sumologic --help
```

### Continuous Integration
Run through the full suite of tests and linters by running

```bash
poetry run tox -e py
```

These must pass in order for PR's to be merged.


### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-sumologic
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-sumologic --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-sumologic target-jsonl
```

See the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the SDK to
develop your own taps and targets.
