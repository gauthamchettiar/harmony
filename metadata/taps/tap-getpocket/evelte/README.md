# tap-getpocket

`tap-getpocket` is a Singer tap for GetPocket.

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

## Installation

(If you are not running Meltano, see the instructions below to run this singer tap) 

To install this tap, go to your Meltano project folder. If you don't have a Meltano project yet, create one following 
the instructions [here](https://meltano.com/docs/getting-started.html#create-your-meltano-project).
From within your project, you can now add your custom tap:
```bash
meltano add --custom extractor tap-getpocket
```
You will be prompted to choose between one of the following options:
- PyPI package name:
    tap-getpocket
- Git repository URL:
    git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-getpocket.git
- local directory, in editable/development mode:
    -e extract/tap-getpocket

This tap is available on PyPi, sou you can go with option 1 entering `tap-getpocket`.
If you want to use the git repository URL, enter `https://github.com/evelte/tap-getpocket`
Alternatively, download the package from github and provide the local path into option 3.

When prompted for capabilities and settings, enter the following:
```bash
(capabilities) [[]]: catalog,discover,state
(settings) [[]]: access_token:password,consumer_key:string,start_date:date_iso8601,favorite:boolean,state:string,detail_type:string,tag:string
```

See instructions on the configuration process [below](#Configuration).

### Running the Singer Tap without Meltano
Create and activate a Python 3 virtual environment for the tap (tap-getpocket)

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/tap-getpocket
source ~/.virtualenvs/tap-getpocket/bin/activate
# Install the Tap using pip:
pip install tap-getpocket
```

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-getpocket --about
```

Edit the Tap's config file (config.json) to include any necessary credentials or parameters. The file should look something like this:
```json
{
  "consumer_key": "xxxyourconsumerkeyxxx",
  "access_token": "xxxyouraccesstokenxxx",
  "favorite": true
}
```

This tap supports discovery mode, you can run it to obtain the catalog:

```bash
~/.virtualenvs/tap-getpocket/bin/tap-getpocket --config config.json --discover > catalog.json
``` 
Depending on what features the Tap supports, you may need to add metadata in the catalog for stream/field selection or replication-method.

Run the Tap in sync mode:

```bash
~/.virtualenvs/tap-getpocket/bin/tap-getpocket --config config.json --catalog catalog.json
```

The output should consist of SCHEMA, RECORD, STATE, and METRIC messages.
If you install a target, you can run the complete pipeline as follows:

```bash
~/.virtualenvs/tap-getpocket/bin/tap-getpocket | ~/.virtualenvs/target_jsonl/bin/target-jsonl --config config.json
```

## Authentication

Pocket does not closely follow the OAuth standard, and the user has to follow the following instructions **once** to 
obtain an access toke for the API authentication.

### Create a Pocket Application

You need to create a Pocket application in Pocketâ€™s developer portal to access your Pocket data. This app will only 
visible to you and only serves the purpose of acquiring the credentials for the API.
If you already have an application, you can see your list of existing `consumer_key`
[here](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/), after logging into your pocket account. You can use one of the available 
keys, or create a new one filling the form [here](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new/). Be sure to select the 
"Retrieve" permission, which is the only one needed for this tap.
After getting your key, make sure to add it to your environment variables or `meltano.yml`.
For example to set your environment variable, run:

```bash
export TAP_GETPOCKET_CONSUMER_KEY=xxxy_yourconsumerkey_xxx
```

### Get Access Token

After getting your consumer_key, you can use the authentication script provided in the package `utils/authenticate.py`
in order to get your `access_token` to authenticate against the API service. You can also get the script 
[here](https://github.com/evelte/tap-getpocket/blob/master/utils/authenticate.py).
You can use wget to get the script and run it locally from within your meltano project folder:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evelte/tap-getpocket/master/utils/authenticate.py
```

This script will use the consumer key provided by you directly as argument. If none provided, the script searches for
it in the environment variables or in the `meltano.yml` file. The script assumes to be executed from whithin the utils
folder or alternatively from the root folder where the `meltano.yml` file is located. If no consumer key is found, the 
user will be prompted to insert one via `input()`.
After concluding the authentication flow with success, the script returns the `access_code`, which should be added to 
your environment variables or your config file.

You should now be able to see your authentication credentials when running
```bash
meltano config tap-getpocket list
```

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

There are 2 required config values to run this tap:
* `consumer_key`
* `access token`

Both should be available after concluding the previous authentication [step](#Get-Access-Token). A full list of 
supported settings and capabilities for this tap is available by running:
```bash
meltano invoke tap-getpocket --about
```

Optional settings to filter the results requested from the API include:
* start_date (The earliest record date to sync. Default is '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z')
* favorite (None, 0 or 1)
* state (unread, read or all)
* detail_type (basic or complete)
* tag (tag_name or _untagged_ for only items without tag)

If you are using Meltano you can add the settings directly on meltano.yml. You can see your current values running:
```bash
meltano config tap-getpocket list
```

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-getpocket` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap via Meltano

By now you should be able to invoke the tap with all your settings from the previous steps:
```bash
meltano invoke tap-getpocket
```


### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-getpocket --version
tap-getpocket --help
tap-getpocket --config config.json --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_getpocket/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-getpocket` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-getpocket --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-getpocket
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-getpocket --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-getpocket target-jsonl
```
