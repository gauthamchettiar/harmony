## Usage

You can easily run `tap-tiktok` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-tiktok --version
tap-tiktok --help
tap-tiktok --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_tiktok/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-tiktok` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-tiktok --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-tiktok
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-tiktok --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-tiktok target-jsonl
```
