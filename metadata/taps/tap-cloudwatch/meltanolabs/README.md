## Settings

| Setting              | Required | Default | Description |
|:---------------------|:--------:|:-------:|:------------|
| aws_access_key_id    | False    | None    | The access key for your AWS account. |
| aws_secret_access_key| False    | None    | The secret key for your AWS account. |
| aws_session_token    | False    | None    | The session key for your AWS account. This is only needed when you are using temporary credentials. |
| aws_profile          | False    | None    | The AWS credentials profile name to use. The profile must be configured and accessible. |
| aws_endpoint_url     | False    | None    | The complete URL to use for the constructed client. |
| aws_region_name      | False    | None    | The AWS region name (e.g. us-east-1)  |
| start_date           | True     | None    | The earliest record date to sync |
| end_date             | False    | None    | The last record date to sync. This tap uses a 5 minute buffer to allow Cloudwatch logs to arrive in full. If you request data from current time it will automatically adjust your end_date to now - 5 mins. |
| log_group_name       | True     | None    | The log group on which to perform the query. |
| query                | True     | None    | The query string to use. For more information, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html). |
| batch_increment_s    | False    |    3600 | The size of the time window to query by, default 3,600 seconds (i.e. 1 hour). If the result set for a batch is greater than the max limit of 10,000 records then the tap will query the same window again where >= the most recent record received. This means that the same data is potentially being scanned >1 times but < 2 times, depending on the amount the results set went over the 10k max. For example a batch window with 15k records would scan the 15k once, receiving 10k results, then scan ~5k again to get the rest. The net result is the same data was scanned ~1.5 times for that batch. To avoid this you should set the batch window to avoid exceeding the 10k limit. |
| stream_maps          | False    | None    | Config object for stream maps capability. For more information check out [Stream Maps](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/stream_maps.html). |
| stream_map_config    | False    | None    | User-defined config values to be used within map expressions. |
| flattening_enabled   | False    | None    | 'True' to enable schema flattening and automatically expand nested properties. |
| flattening_max_depth | False    | None    | The max depth to flatten schemas. |

### Implementation Details

1. The tap always leaves a 5 minute buffer from realtime to handle any late or out of order logs on the Cloudwatch side to guarantee all data is replicated.
Challenges related to this were first observed and discussed in https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-cloudwatch/issues/25.
It means that if you run the tap with no `end_date` configured it will attempt to retrieve data up until current time minus 5 mins.
2. Currently the tap uses a limit of 20 queries at a time. It sends a start_query API call then goes back to retrieve the data later once the query has completed.


### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization

<!--
Developer TODO: If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
-->

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-cloudwatch` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-cloudwatch --version
tap-cloudwatch --help
tap-cloudwatch --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_cloudwatch/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run tox -e pytest
```

Coverage reports are generated at `tap_cloudwatch/tests/codecoverage/`.

You can also test the `tap-cloudwatch` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-cloudwatch --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-cloudwatch
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-cloudwatch --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-cloudwatch target-jsonl
```

### SDK Dev Guide

See the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the SDK to
develop your own taps and targets.

### Further Features

Using create_export_task to efficiently bulk export to S3 then read that data.
