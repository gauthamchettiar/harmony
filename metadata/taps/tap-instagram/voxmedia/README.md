`tap-instagram` is a Singer tap for the [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api) built 
with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

## Installation

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` Update the below as needed to correctly describe the install procedure. For instance, if you do not have a PyPi repo, or if you want users to directly install from your git repo, you can modify this step as appropriate.

```bash
pipx install tap-instagram
```

## Supported Streams

The Instagram tap replicates the following data:
* [Users](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user)

## Configuration

**The tap accepts the following config options:**

- **`ig_user_ids: List[str]` (required)**: List of user IDs of Instagram Business Accounts or Instagram Creator Accounts. One way to 
find the user ID is by navigating to
> [Facebook Business Manager Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings) > Accounts > Instagram accounts > [Your Account]

and you will see the user ID in the URL - https://business.facebook.com/instagram-account-v2s/{user_id}?business_id={business_id}

- **`access_token: str` (required)**: A long-lived **user access token**, which can be obtained by following 
[these instructions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/access-tokens). Ensure the access token has the 
following permissions:
  - `instagram_basic`
  - `instagram_manage_insights`
  - `pages_show_list`
  - `pages_read_engagement`

  **NOTE: You will need to create a Facebook App if you do not have one already to be able to generate an access token**

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-instagram --about
```


## Usage

You can easily run `tap-instagram` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-instagram --version
tap-instagram --help
tap-instagram --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_instagram/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-instagram` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-instagram --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-instagram
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-instagram --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-instagram target-jsonl
```

### SDK Dev Guide

See the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the SDK to 
develop your own taps and targets.
